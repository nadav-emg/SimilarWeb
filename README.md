This App contains two different applications
1. WebApp (client)

This app uss YouTube API for fetching video details.
For playing video it using Youtube player, 
I looked for a framework that's allow me to subscribe to player events (ENDED).

To run the app:
1. npm install
2. npm run build.start.server
3. npm run build.start.client
